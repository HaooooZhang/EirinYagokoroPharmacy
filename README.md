# **Eirin Yagokoro‘s Pharmacy | 蓬莱药局 | 蓬莱薬局**


Eirin Yagokoro's Pharmacy is a fan-made Minecraft Mod based on _TouHou Project_, introducing potions from the House of Eternity.

Fabric Version requires the **Fabric API** as a dependency!

It's just a meme entry from a newcomer, so there must be a multitude of problems. If there is any question, please make contact with us.

## **Q&A**

**A.**  **Why isn’t there an xxx version?**

**Q.**  Eirin Yagokoro's Pharmacy is a simple meme mod casually created by the author in their spare time and is not actively maintained. Thus, only certain fun versions will be experimented with :)

**A. Is there other features to be added in the future?**

**Q.** According to official lore, Eirin Yagokoro has a few more potion-related spell cards like **Butterfly Dream Pill - Nightmare**, **Butterfly Dream Pill**, and **Jade Rabbit Incense**, and we'll look into filling them out.

## **Introduction** 

- **Potion of Hourai**

    Yagokoro Eirin’s forbidden medicine, possessing the power to be undead. After consuming the Hourai Potion, the player will no longer die.

    Yet, eternal life may well be a curse. Once the Hourai Potion is taken, impurity floods the body, and there is truly no turning back.

Crafting the Hourai potion requires adding **Flesh** to **Ultramarine Potion** during brewing.

- **Potion of Ultramarine**

    Eirin Yagokoro's healing potion, which also removes defilements. 

   What is defilement?  Simply put, they’re bad omens.

    Beyond that, its Ultramarine effects also grant the player a "second chance"—by temporarily reducing maximum health, the player can avoid death.

Oh, and while **Potion of Ultramarine** has purifying properties, it _**absolutely cannot**_ cleanse the endless corruption brought by the Hourai Potion.

    Crafting **Potion of Ultramarine** requires adding a **Golden Apple** to an **Awkward Potion** during brewing.

- **Potion of Unrivaled**

> "The master said this is only for emergencies... Huh? You drank three bottles?!"

An emergency medicine developed by Yagokoro Eirin for Reisen, granting the ability to **rapidly boost attack and health for a short time**.  
Though effective, don’t get too greedy (lol).  
Crafting Unrivaled Medicine requires adding **Torchflower** to an **Awkward Potion** during brewing.

- **Flesh**

    A material for crafting the Hourai Potion, obtained by shooting oneself while tainted by impurity.
